 * Write a program that requests the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature. The program
 * should read the temperature as a type double number and pass it as an argument to
 * a user-supplied function called Temperatures(). This function should calculate the
 * Celsius equivalent and the Kelvin equivalent and display all three temperatures with a
 * precision of two places to the right of the decimal. It should identify each value with the
 * temperature scale it represents. Here is the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:
 *
 * Celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32.0)
 *
 * The Kelvin scale, commonly used in science, is a scale in which 0 represents absolute
 * zero, the lower limit to possible temperatures. Here is the formula for converting Celsius
 * to Kelvin:
 *
 * Kelvin = Celsius + 273.16
 *
 * The Temperatures() function should use const to create symbolic representations of
 * the three constants that appear in the conversions. The main( ) function should use
 * a loop to allow the user to enter temperatures repeatedly, stopping when a q or other
 * nonnumeric value is entered. Use the fact that scanf ( ) returns the number of items
 * read, so it will return 1 if it reads a number, but it won't return 1 if the user enters q. The
 * == operator tests for equality, so you can use it to compare the return value of scanf()
 * with 1.
