 * Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of miles traveled and the number
 * of gallons of gasoline consumed. It should then calculate and display the miles-per-gallon
 * value, showing one place to the right of the decimal. Next, using the fact that one gallon
 * is about 3.785 liters and one mile is about 1.609 kilometers, it should convert the mile-
 * per-gallon value to a liters-per-100-km value, the usual European way of expressing fuel
 * consumption, and display the result, showing one place to the right of the decimal. Note
 * that the U. S. scheme measures the distance traveled per amount of fuel (higher is better),
 * whereas the European scheme measures the amount of fuel per distance (lower is better).
 * Use symbolic constants (using const or #define) for the two converslon factors.
