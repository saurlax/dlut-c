 * Write a program that asks the user to enter a height in centimeters and then displays the
 * height in centimeters and in feet and inches. Fractional centimeters and inches should
 * be allowed, and the program should allow the user to continue entering heights until a
 * nonpositive value is entered. A sample run should look like this:
 * 
 * Enter a height in centimeters: 182
 * 182.0 cm = 5 feet, 11.7 inches
 * Enter a height in centimeters (<=0 to quit): 168.7
 * 168.0 cm = 5 feet, 6.4inches
 * Enter a height in centimeters (<=0 to quit): 0
 * bye
