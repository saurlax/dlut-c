 * an interest equal to 10% of the original investment.) Deirdre invests $100 at 5% interest
 * compounded annually. (That is, interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous
 * addition of interest.) Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value
 * of Deirdre's investment to exceed the value of Daphne's investment. Also show the two
